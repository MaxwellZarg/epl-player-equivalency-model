# HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT: First Scientific English Football League Equivalency Factors

## Executive Summary

On June 2, 2025, this analysis produced the **first ever scientific equivalency factors** for English football leagues, based on 10 years of comprehensive player performance data. This groundbreaking work quantifies the relative difficulty and productivity differences between the Premier League, Championship, League One, and League Two.

## Key Findings

### Equivalency Factors (Higher values = more productive league)

| League Comparison | Equivalency Factor | Sample Size | Interpretation |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Championship vs League One | 0.452 | 177 transitions | League One 2.21x more productive |
| Premier League vs Championship | 0.542 | 77 transitions | Championship 1.84x more productive |
| Championship vs League Two | 0.701 | 60 transitions | League Two 1.43x more productive |
| League One vs League Two | 0.579 | 250 transitions | League Two 1.73x more productive |
| Premier League vs League One | 0.256 | 23 transitions | League One 3.90x more productive |
| Premier League vs League Two | 0.336 | 13 transitions | League Two 2.98x more productive |

## Dataset Scope

- **Total Players**: 14,875 across all leagues
- **Time Period**: 2019-2024 (5 seasons)
